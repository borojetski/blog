I'm Paul, a freelance web developer. I have a varied history, but have been coding for several years. Lately I've been into three.js and 3D modeling, but also pixel art and game design. You'd think there would be a coherent way to marry the two but I refuse.

This blog is meant to be somewhere for me to channel whatever my obsession of the week is. Also, rather than investing in platforms that change their pricing and terms of service in whatever way will make the numbers go up, this blog and its trivial insights will still freely have its place somewhere out here on the wider internet. Don't expect a coherent theme here, just another perspective on whatever I'm into at the moment.
